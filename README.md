## Chat OP

This is a group chatting application where multipel users can simultaneously converse with each other on this application and can login or signin using firebase-auth with their valid email id.

## How to run this locally on your machine

You can clone the repo using git clone <repository link> which you will find on the top of the "Code".
After cloning create your own .env file and get your own firebase apikey and other variables. Make sure to name them in this manner or else they might not work.
The naming convention is going to be like this :
VITE_apiKey
